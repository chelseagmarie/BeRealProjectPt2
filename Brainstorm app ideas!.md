# App Idea 1: LateOnWheels
**What:** 
The public transportation system can be quite challenging to manage and navigate. Buses are often late or early, making it difficult to plan ahead. Deciding when to leave your house and which bus to take can be a hassle. There are numerous variables to consider in order to arrive at your destination on time, and users often have to navigate these on their own.

This app aims to provide students with peace of mind by alerting them when they should leave their house and which bus they should catch to arrive at their destination on time.

**Who:** 
This app is specifically designed for students who rely on the public transportation system. It functions as a smartphone application with alert notifications to keep users informed. These notifications serve to update users on the status of their bus, whether it's arriving early, delayed, or on time. This allows users to adjust their schedule accordingly, either preparing faster or taking more time. Additionally, the app takes traffic conditions into account to recommend the most optimal route and bus option to ensure users reach their destination punctually.

**Why:** We decided to develop this application because public transportation has consistently been a source of discomfort for us. We often struggle to meet deadlines for when we should leave, determine the most efficient bus route, identify bus stops, and deal with various other issues that arise. This ongoing challenge has affected our punctuality and impacted our coursework as students, leading to instances of arriving late or even missing class entirely, depending on the day's circumstances. To address this, we aimed to create an application that streamlines the entire process by providing guidance on when to be ready, which bus to take, and any potential inconveniences to anticipate along the way, all with the goal of ensuring punctuality for class.

**Challenges:**
* Finding a free API that allows us to grab bus schedulues
* Finding a way to parse through the schedules and decide what bus would be most effective
* Finding a way to match the location to destination with a bus route
* Finding a way to determine what the optimal time to leave your house would be based on schedules. 
# App Idea 2: DiscoDating
**What:** So, what exactly is DiscoDating? The concept involves utilizing a series of APIs (which we're still researching) to create a unique music discovery experience. Ideally, users would be presented with snippets of songs and given the option to swipe left if they didn't like the song or swipe right if they loved it.

If a user swipes left, we would take note of their preferences and avoid showing similar artists or music styles in the future. Conversely, if they swipe right, indicating they enjoyed the song, we would provide more details about the artist and other relevant information. This process would help us understand their music preferences and tailor recommendations accordingly, introducing them to new, perhaps lesser-known artists in the same style.

Users could continue exploring music in this style unless they opt to change their preferences, in which case the process starts anew, allowing them to "date" music snippets to find their next favorite track.

**Who:** As music lovers, we are always on the lookout for the next hip new artist or that song that captures our hearts. Music has the power to surround us with joy and create monumental experiences, whether it's a track that shifts our perspective or a new dance anthem that we know will be on repeat forever. However, even as passionate music enthusiasts, we often struggle to discover fresh talent and tracks. That's where the idea of "speed dating" our music comes in. If we find it challenging to unearth new music gems, it's likely that many others share the same struggle.

**Why:** Music plays a significant role in our lives, personally enriching us in countless ways. When we gathered to brainstorm solutions for common issues, the challenge of discovering new music emerged as a recurring theme among us. This sentiment was echoed by many of our friends and acquaintances, highlighting a widespread desire to explore new genres and time periods, albeit with limited guidance on where to begin.

Enter DiscoDating. Born out of this need, DiscoDating offers users a platform to explore new music, genres, and time periods through short snippets of songs that they can swipe left or right on. This approach aims to simplify the process of discovering music that resonates with them, as well as facilitate exploration of new genres by presenting users with curated selections akin to a "musical date." Whether users wish to delve into a specific genre or explore a diverse range of music, DiscoDating offers a tailored experience based on their preferences.

**Challenges:**
* Finding a free API that allows us to obtain 30 second snippets of music
* Finding a way to recommend music based on the swiping people are doing

# App Idea 3: GymBuddies
**What:** GymBuddies is an app aimed at promoting community building in sports and other athletic acitivities. This app groups people up by skill level, interests and schedule.
**Who:** This app is aimed at people who want to start working out but don't know where to start and don't want to start alone.
**Why:** A large percentage of people want to becom emore active but the gym can be an intimidating. Reaching out to people to join you at the gym can also be an intimidating endevour especially if they're at a different skill level and you feel you'd hold them back. This app makes it much easier to break that wall and get people to the gym without that burden on their shoulders.

**Challenges:**
* Fostering a secure environment to prevent unwanted situations
* Identity verification process can be dificult to implement

# App Idea 4: SportsMeetups

**What:** SportsMeetups is a community app to get like-minded sporting individuals together to play games, tournaments, etc. Users can make posts of a sports pick-up game and its location and time. Users can also rsvp to let the owner of the post know that they will be attending and comment under the post.

**Who:** Sports enjoyers and people who would like to play a casual pick-up game of a sport on their own time in their area.

**Why:** There are people that love playing sports, but may not always have someone to play with, especially team sports like volleyball. They can have easy access to people within a certain range that are playing the sport and open to playing with others on the app. This app can get people to leave their houses and make connections with others in their area, get exercise, see the sun/touch grass, and just have a great time!

**Challenges:** 
* Instituting commenting could create complicated issue with threads


# App Idea 5: ArtFart
**What:** Part of the mystique of art involves learning and acquiring pieces from other artists. The sharing and swapping of ideas and artwork are enticing because the art community thrives on shared experiences and the opportunity to visit museums for artistic immersion. What if we provided artists with a platform to exchange their artwork with others, simplifying the process and creating a space for people to share their experiences and build a community of artists together? Art exchanges could occur between individuals or businesses willing to display artwork. Additionally, this app could function as a hiring service, allowing users to commission artists on the spot if needed. Essentially, it would be the art of bartering with art itself.

**Who:** This app would be aimed at artists who are interested in trading their artwork with other artists to enrich the local art community. Trades would take place at local art venues, creating a geocaching-like experience where users can visit the designated art spots, exchange their artwork, and explore the surrounding area together. Participants would have the opportunity to share comments or critiques about the artwork if they wish. Additionally, users could bring their artwork to businesses willing to display it, thereby enhancing the artists' image, reputation, and reach. This initiative would foster a sense of community and shared experience among participants, expanding the impact of art beyond individual boundaries. Furthermore, this platform would welcome non-artists to join the community and explore various art forms and mediums.

**Why:** The art community is continuously expanding, especially with the proliferation of self-teaching resources available on the internet. However, this growth often occurs individually, with artists developing their skills in isolation from the larger group. In the past, people frequented museums, and artists were highly regarded within specific art eras such as Baroque and Cubism. During these periods, art reflected the collective climate of the time, evolving together as a cohesive whole. In contrast, today's art community often lacks this sense of cohesion, with little exchange or collective judgment of artwork. To thrive and expand as a unified entity once again, the art community could benefit from reestablishing connections and trading artwork, thereby reintroducing the collaborative spirit and realism of past eras. 
**Challenges:** 
* Finding a way to facillitate conversation
* Finding a way to facilitate locations
* Finding a way to ensure they do not have malicious intentions
* Finding an environment where this would work
*
